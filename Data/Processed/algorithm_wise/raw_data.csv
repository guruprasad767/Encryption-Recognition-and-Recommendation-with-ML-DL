"The creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, is teaming up with another US tech giant, a Japanese investment firm and an Emirati sovereign wealth fund to build $500bn (£405bn) of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the United States."
"The new company, called The Stargate Project, was announced at the White House by President Donald Trump who billed it the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history and said it would help keep the future of technology in the US."
"But Elon Musk - both a top adviser to Trump and rival to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman - on Wednesday said the venture does not actually have the money it has pledged to invest."
"Investment in AI is currently exploding, driving demand for new data centres while also raising concerns about the huge amounts of water and power the facilities require."
"The venture is a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, Japan's Softbank - led by Masayoshi Son - and MGX, a tech investment arm of the United Arab Emirates government."
"The companies said the new venture, which was in the works before Trump took office, had $100bn in funding available immediately, with the rest to come over four years, creating an estimated 100,000 jobs."
"Commenting on a post on X where OpenAI detailed the plans, Musk, who owns the platform, wrote They don't actually have the money."
"I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you'll mostly put US first."
"He, though, has also been feuding with Altman since leaving OpenAI's board in 2018 and launching his own AI start-up."
"A source close to Stargate said it was not clear where Musk had gotten his information and that the company was well-positioned to deploy $100 bn."
"Stargate's first data centre is under construction in Texas, according to Oracle's chief technology officer, Larry Ellison, and more will be built in other US locations."
"I think this will be the most important project of this era, said Altman at Trump's Tuesday announcement, standing alongside the President at the White House."
"We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr President, he added, even though the project was underway before Trump won November's election."
"'Most important project of this era' The US is already the world leader in AI investment, vastly outspending any other country, and its big tech companies have been making major investments into data centres in the last year."
"Microsoft, one of the OpenAI's major backers, said earlier this month it was on track to invest $80bn to build out AI-focused data centres this year."
"It is also involved in a $100bn venture that includes BlackRock and MGX and is focused on making AI data centre investments."
"Amazon has been pouring money into the centres at a similar scale, announcing two projects worth about $10bn each in just the last two months."
"In a report last year, McKinsey said that global demand for data centre capacity would more than triple by 2030, growing between 19% and 27% annually by 2030."
"For developers to meet that demand, the consultancy estimated that at least twice the capacity would have to be built by 2030 as has been constructed since 2000."
"But analysts have warned that the process is likely to be bogged down by issues such as power and land constraints and permitting."
"I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency, he said, stressing the importance of keeping AI in the US."
"Along with Musk's scepticism about funding for the specific project, there are growing concerns generally about the data centres taxing energy supplies and questions about the role of foreign investors."
"In one of his final acts in the White House, former President Joe Biden put forward rules that would restrict exports of AI-related chips to dozens of countries around the world, saying the move would help the US control the industry."
"He also issued orders related to the development of data centres on government land, which spotlighted a role for clean energy in powering the centres."
"The US Navy has released stunning images showing its incredible new drone-destroying laser weapon in action for the first time."
"The HELIOS system was tested aboard the USS Preble, with photos capturing its bright beam shooting an unmanned aerial vehicle out of the sky."
"HELIOS, which stands for High Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance, was developed by Lockheed Martin in 2021 and delivered to the Navy a year later."
"The system blasts more than 60 kilowatts of directed energy, enough to power up to 60 homes, at the speed of light and can hit targets up to five miles away."
"The testing comes as threats against America's warships are growing as foreign nations stock their arsenals with drones and anti-ship missiles."
"The US Naval Institute said in a recent report: 'The drone threat has been around for years, but the Navy has yet to prioritize defending against these easily acquired weapons."
"'Expecting sailors who shoot shotguns, rifles, or machine guns twice a year on a range to be able to engage multiple small, fast-moving targets is unreasonable, 'the report added."
"'Even if a few sailors were expert shooters capable of shooting down drones, it likely would take a few minutes from the first report of a potential drone to identify the drone, raise the alarm, and bring key weapons and associated ammunition to bear against the threat—time the ship might not have."
"But the Navy sees its new HELIOS as a way to fight back, showing off its capabilities on the open ocean."
"'CCM supported the Navy’s demonstration on USS Preble (DDG 88) to verify and validate the functionality, performance, and capability of the HEL with Integrated Optical Dazzler and Surveillance system against an unmanned aerial vehicle target, it shared in a report."
"The HELIOS system was tested aboard the USS Preble, with photos showing its bright beam shooting an unmanned aerial vehicle out of the sky"
"The test comes as a Homeland Security Advisor and billionaire Marc Andreessen suggested AI-powered jets will be the main fighters in future wars."
"Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast in November, Andreessen said jets that travel five times the speed of sound, Mach 5, are going to be more common 'within a few years."
"He explain that instead of needing the most soldiers and material to win, people with the most technology and money will take over."
"Andreessen also noted that there are 'a bunch of reasons' why he believes a future of AI-piloted fighter jets is all but inevitable."
"'But the other big thing is, if you don't have a human in the plane, you don't have 'the Spam in the Can."
"'You don't have the human body in the plane to keep alive, which means you can be a lot faster,' the billionaire White House advisor continued, 'much higher G-forces."

"A picture of the bird itself is, of course, of the first importance, but any fact in its biography which the camera can be employed to portray is within the province of bird photography."
", which must be set forth with the pen; there are others, such as its haunts, nesting site, nest, eggs, the appearance and development of its young, where the camera is so far ahead of the pen in its power of graphic representation that it is a waste of time to use the former when circumstances permit the utilization of the latter."
"A photograph of a marsh or wood showing the favorite haunts of a species is worth more than pages of description."
"A picture of a bird’s nesting site conveys a better idea of the situation than words can possibly give, while in place of such vague phrases as “nest of coarse grasses, weed 2stalks, rootlets, etc."
"The shape and pattern of markings of the eggs may also be well shown with the camera, while the appearance of the young at birth, their development, and often the manner in which they are fed, may all be portrayed by the camera with a realism which convinces one of the truthfulness of the result."
"By the exercise of much patience and ingenuity we may also photograph the adult bird, showing it at rest or in motion, brooding its eggs or caring for its young."
"Under favorable conditions such pictures may possess an exactness of detail which makes them perfect representations of the original, giving not alone position and expression, but the arrangement of the feathers, and they then have scientific value unequaled by the best productions of the artist’s brush or pencil."
"From the nature of the case, perfection in this branch of bird photography is not always attained; nevertheless, even pictures which are failures from a photographic standpoint may be of interest to the naturalist."
"They may be lacking in detail and still give pose, thus furnishing models from which drawings containing all structural essentials may be made."
"The camera may also supply us with graphic records of the few large colonies of birds yet existing in this country, thereby preserving for all time definite impressions of conditions which are rapidly becoming things of the past."
"What an invaluable addition to the history of the Great Auk would be a series of photographs 3from Funk Island, taken during the period of its existence there!"
"Of what surpassing interest would be photographs of the former flights of Wild Pigeons, which the younger generations of to-day can with difficulty believe occurred!"
"—As a onetime sportsman, who yielded to none in his enjoyment of the chase, I can affirm that there is a fascination about the hunting of wild animals with a camera as far ahead of the pleasure to be derived from their pursuit with shotgun or rifle as the sport found in shooting Quail is beyond that of breaking clay “Pigeons”."
"Continuing the comparison, from a sportsman’s standpoint, hunting with a camera is the highest development of man’s inherent love of the chase."
"The killing of a bird with a gun seems little short of murder after one has attempted to capture its image with a lens."
"The demands on the skill and patience of the bird photographer are endless, and his pleasure is intensified in proportion to the nature of the difficulties to be overcome, and in the event of success it is perpetuated by the infinitely more satisfactory results obtained."
"He does not rejoice over a bag of mutilated flesh and feathers, but in the possession of a trophy—an eloquent token of his prowess as a hunter, a talisman which holds the power of revivifying the circumstances attending its acquisition."
"What mental vision of falling birds can be as potent as the actual picture of living birds in their homes?"
"And how immeasurably one’s memories are 4brightened by the fact that this is not a picture of what has been but of what is!"
"The camera thus opens the door to a field of sport previously closed to those who love birds too much to find pleasure in killing them; to whom Bob-White’s ringing whistle does not give rise to murderous speculations as to the number in his family, but to an echo of the season’s joy which his note voices."
"They therefore have a new incentive to take them out of doors; for however much we love Nature for Nature’s sake, there are few of us whose pleasure in an outing is not intensified by securing some definite, lasting result."
"We are not all poets and seers, finding sufficient reward for a hard day’s tramp in a sunset glow or the song of a bird."
"Enjoy these things as we may, who would not like to perpetuate the one or the other in some tangible form?"
"And here we have one of the reasons for the collecting of birds and eggs long after the collector’s needs are satisfied."
"He goes on duplicating and reduplicating merely to appease the almost universal desire to possess any admired although useless object."
"Once let him appreciate, however, the pleasure of hunting with a camera, the greater skill required, and the infinitely greater value of the results to be obtained, and he will have no further use for gun, climbing irons, and egg drill."
"Furthermore, the camera hunter possesses the advantage over the so-called true sportsman, in that all is game that falls to his gun; there is not a bird too small or too tame to be unworthy of his attention; nor are there seasonal restrictions to be observed, 5nor temptations to break game laws, but every day in the year he is free to go afield, and at all times he may find something to claim his attention."
"Finally, there is to be added to the special charm of bird photography the general charm attending the use of the camera."
"Thousands of people are finding pleasure in the comparatively prosaic employment of photographing houses, bridges, and other patiently immovable objects wholly at the camerist’s mercy."
"Imagine, then, the far greater enjoyment of successes not only of real value in themselves, but undeniable tributes to one’s skill both as photographer and hunter."
"Nor should this introduction be closed without due acknowledgment to the educational value of photography, to its power to widen the scope of our vision, and to increase our appreciation of the beautiful."
"There is a magic in the lens, the ground glass, and the dark-cloth which transform the commonest object into a thing of rarest interest."
"Under favorable conditions there is no great difference in the results secured with the ordinary camera and lens of any reputable maker and those of the highest class."
"My own work has for the greater part been done with an outfit costing about thirty dollars; and although the best lens is, of course, to be desired it is not a necessity, and cost therefore is no more an obstacle to the hunting of birds with a camera than it is to their pursuit with a gun."
"—Individual taste will doubtless govern the size of the camera chosen, but most naturalists and sportsmen consider the camera carrying a plate four by five inches as the one best adapted to their wants, and with this decision I heartily agree."
"The advantages of size, weight, and economy, both as regards the camera, its holders, and plates, are all in favor of the 4 × 5, while as far as the bird photographer is concerned, it is not often that he has need of anything larger."
"The image of a bird will rarely be without adequate setting in a space four 7by five inches, which will also be found to be large enough for the portrayal of nests and eggs."
"The 4 × 5 also reduces proportionately in making lantern slides, and if the picture is made the long way of the plate—that is, higher than broad—it can be easily adapted for illustrative purposes in duodecimo or octavo books."
"When a larger picture is desired it can readily be made by enlargement, an increase in size of three diameters, or six times the area, being possible from a sharp negative without undue loss of definition."
"For use from a tripod any one of the several excellent long-focus cameras now on the market will be found to answer every requirement."
"If it is proposed to employ a telephoto lens, care should be taken to select the camera combining greatest bellows length with rigidity."
"A reversible back increases the size somewhat but adds to the length of bellows, and will be found serviceable in the many awkward situations in which the bird photographer is often placed by the nature of his subjects."
"The Kearton brothers have an “adjustable miniature” on the top of their camera, which they state “is used as a sort of view finder when making studies of flying birds."
"When fixed in position and its focus has been set exactly like its working companion beneath it, both are racked out in the same ratio by the screw dominating the larger apparatus."
"”[A] The purposes of this attachment, however, 8will, it seems probable, be better served by the reflecting camera described below, while as a finder alone its place may be taken by the “iconoscope” and other of the prism finders, the brilliant image cast by which is such a striking and satisfactory improvement on the hazy outlines given by the average so-called “finder."
"Kearton; a work of the utmost interest to the animal photographer, who should also read With Nature and a Camera, by the same authors (Cassell & Co."
"For use as a hand-box only two kinds of camera are available, for it must be borne in mind that the set-focus or short-focus, wide angle “snap-shot” cameras, so popular among the button-pressing fraternity, are not adapted to the wants of the bird photographer, who must therefore avail himself of either a twin-lens or a reflecting camera."
"Twin-lens cameras are manufactured by several well-known firms, but the trade size is of too short focus to be desirable."
"The lower lens makes the picture, the upper projects a duplicate of the image cast by the lower lens to a mirror set at an angle of forty-five degrees to the plane of the plate, whence it is reflected upward to a ground glass, which is protected by a hood, on top of the camera."
"To focus perfectly the lenses should be “matched” or “paired”—in short, interchangeable—thereby greatly increasing the cost of the camera, which is also rendered objectionable by its large size."
"The reflecting camera possesses all the advantages of the twin-lens, but requires only one lens, and when in use is not materially larger than the ordinary 4 × 5 long-focus box."
"9The reflecting camera now in my possession was designed and made by John Rowley, of the American Museum of Natural History, and was fully described and illustrated by him in Bird-Lore for April, 1900."
"It resembles the upper half of the twin-lens camera in that a mirror, set at an angle of forty-five degrees to the plate, is interposed between the latter and the lens, and reflects its image to a ground glass on top of the camera."
"This mirror, however, is movable, and the desired object appearing in focus on the ground glass, a lever is pressed downward which raises the mirror to the top of the box, where it automatically releases a focal-plane shutter (see beyond, under The Shutter) directly in front of the plate, when the image-bearing rays, before intercepted and reflected by the mirror, are registered on the plate, from which the slide had previously been drawn."
"When the focal-plane or curtain shutter has been set and the slide drawn from the plate holder, this camera is like a cocked gun, which may be fired the moment it is sighted; or, in other words, the exposure may be made the instant focus is secured."
"With this camera one may take advantage of any offering opportunity to secure a picture of a bird or beast when afield, and this fact, by increasing the possibilities of an outing, adds greatly to its pleasure."
"Rowley has so designed this camera that it may be used from a tripod as well as in the hands; but when the tripod camera is to be left, perhaps for hours, hidden near some bird’s nest, I prefer to employ the long-focus for this purpose, and retain 10the reflecting camera for possible use on the birds that so often approach closely when one is in hiding."
"—Professional photographers differ so widely in their opinions of the relative qualities of the various makes of lenses now on the market, that I approach this subject with diffidence, and, without presuming to offer advice, present the results of my experience both as to lenses and the requirements of the bird photographer."
"For nests with eggs or young birds—subjects which may be approached closely—a six- to eight-inch-focus lens forms a large enough image, and at the same time gives depth of focus and sharpness of definition without the use of the smaller diaphragms."
"In photographing birds, however, it is generally difficult to get within “shooting” distance, and at least a fourteen- to sixteen-inch lens is needed in order to secure an image of sufficient size."
"Depth of focus is here, in my opinion, not desirable, and the focal point—the bird—is brought out more clearly by the fusion of all the objects back of it into a uniform background."
"When a bird, either young or old, is the subject, great speed may be required, and sometimes under light conditions which severely test the qualities of the lens."
"To fully meet these demands of distance and time two lenses would be needed; but, aside from the increased cost and the inconvenience of 11using two lenses, the great size and weight of a long-focus lens are drawbacks."
"These objections are largely overcome by the use of the symmetrical lenses placed in most of the long-focus boxes, or, if expense be not considered, by a “convertible” lens."
"The combined focus of the front and back lenses is seven and a half inches, of either of the lenses alone, fifteen inches."
"The single lens therefore, the distance being the same, gives an image double the size of that cast by the two lenses together."
"The “convertible” lenses of various makers are also separable, and where the rear and front lenses are of different foci three focal lengths are obtainable."
"In a bright light, or where great speed is not required, they do not seem to be as superior to the trade lens as the much higher price would lead one to expect."
"But in dull days, or in the shadow, or where extremely rapid exposures are necessary, their superior qualities become evident."
"My experience with these convertible lenses has been limited to the Zeiss Anastigmat, Series VII a, of which I am now using a No."
"10 with a combined focus of eight inches, the front and rear lenses both having a focal length of fourteen inches."
"This combination is preferred to one in which the component lenses are of different foci, because of the 12greater speed of the two when combined, and furthermore, because, being of the same focus, they could, if occasion arose, be used in a twin-lens box."
"With the former the most rapid exposures can be made successfully, while the latter are sufficiently fast to permit of ordinary instantaneous work."
"This lens is stated to cover a 5 × 8½ plate, and when in use on a 4 × 5 camera gives a high degree of illumination and perfect definition."
"Its disadvantages are lack of speed, an exposure of at least one half a second to a second being required at F."
"8 in bright sunlight, the necessity of extreme care in focusing, and of absolute rigidity of the camera at the time of making the exposure."
"In short, the telephotographer needs more time, both before and after pressing his bulb, than the bird photographer is often accorded."
"However, with such subjects as nests high in trees or on cliffs, Herons and other shore-inhabiting birds, Ducks on the water or Hawks perched in leafless trees, the telephoto will be found serviceable."
"Negatives are frequently secured in which the figure of the bird, while small, is sharp, when, by enlargement, a desirable picture can be made of what in the original was too small to be easily distinguishable."
"An increase in size of two diameters is possible from any fairly sharp negative, but if the object be in perfect focus an increase of four diameters may be made."
"13These enlargements may be made with an enlarging camera or with the aid of a Nehring enlarging lens, which is placed between the front and back lenses of the view lens, when, with the ordinary long-focus camera, a magnification of about four diameters may be obtained, the image being thrown on to a piece of bromide paper in the plate holder."
"Through enlargement many apparently worthless negatives become of value, and in some instances pictures can be made from different parts of the same negative."
"It gives deceptive results, and those who are not familiar with its powers are apt to accord the photographer undue praise for his apparent skill in successfully approaching some bird or beast which may have been far out of range."
"As a matter of information, however, it seems eminently desirable to accompany all enlarged pictures by a statement of the extent of their magnification, and throughout this book this plan is followed."
"Consequently, when there is no mention of enlargement, it may be accepted as a fact that the print from which the reproduction was made was obtained from the negative by contact."
"In illustration of these suggestions in regard to the proper lenses for bird photography, a series of pictures is presented which shows the results to be 14obtained under the same conditions with different lenses."
"Placing a mounted Flicker (Colaptes auratus) on a fence post, and setting up my tripod at a measured distance of fifty feet, a series of test exposures was made, of which three are presented as follows: First,2 eight-inch lens (Zeiss Convertible Series VII a, No."
"Commenting on the results of these tests it may first be mentioned that in the “Unicum” shutter employed exposures of a so-called “¹⁄₁₀₀” and “¹⁄₂₅” seconds gave exactly the same results both with the combined eight-inch lens and the front fourteen-inch lens; the actual time, however, was doubtless not far from ¹⁄₂₅ of a second."
"Continuing our comparison, 16we observe that the eight-inch gives a fairly wide field, excellent depth of focus, but a very small image of the bird, for which alone the picture has been made."
"With the fourteen-inch we decrease the extent of the field nearly one half and almost double the size of the object pictured."
"This, however, has been done at the loss of depth of focus, not even the first of the line of posts running directly into the background being sharply defined, while with the eight-inch all are in focus."
"The telephoto gives an enlargement of about six diameters of the image thrown by eight-inch lens, and three diameters increase of that of the fourteen-inch lens."
"Having now made three good negatives in the field, we may, by enlargement, improve on the image of the bird obtained."
"The possibilities in this direction are clearly shown by the three enlargements accompanying the contact prints from their respective negatives."
"In each instance the enlargement is about three diameters, and the telephoto negative of course furnishes the most satisfactory picture."
"When the difficulties of telephotography are considered, however, and the ¹⁄₂₅-second exposure of the fourteen-inch lens, which permits of hand work, is compared with the one second of the telephoto, we believe that for general work in photographing 19birds a lens having a focal length of at least fourteen inches will be found the most satisfactory."
"It should be added that, in order to make them wholly comparable, the three contact prints as well as the enlargements were made on enameled bromide paper."
"—For fairly rapid, slow, and time exposures, a lens shutter, such as is sold with trade cameras, will be found suitable."
"The “Iris Diaphragm” shutter is noiseless 20when used for slow exposures of two or three seconds, a matter of much importance in making time pictures of sitting birds, who are apt to turn their head if they hear the click of the shutter."
"The “Unicum” shutter is lighter, responds quickly, has a lever to which a thread may be attached for making exposures from a distance, can be easily diaphragmed from the rear, but is not wholly noiseless."
"There are also other shutters, each possessing good points of its own, and the selection of any one of them for use in medium rapid, slow, or time work can be left to the photographer, who should, however, remember that the time scales on these shutters represent degrees of difference and not exact measurements of time, and that there is great variation in the exposures of different shutters of the same make when similarly adjusted."
"The scale on most of these shutters calls for a speed not exceeding a ¹⁄₁₀₀ part of a second, but this is far too slow an exposure to successfully photograph a flying bird at short range where a speed of at least ¹⁄₅₀₀ of a second is required."
"For very rapid work the choice is limited to one kind of shutter—that is, the focal-plane, which in effect is a curtain with an adjustable slit which is placed directly in front of the plate."
"Great speed with this shutter is in part secured by increasing the tension of the spring, which acts as its motive 21power, but more particularly by decreasing the width of the slit."
"Assuming, therefore, that it takes one second for the slit to pass from top to bottom of a plate four inches high, and that the slit is one inch in width, it follows that each portion of the plate is exposed to the light for a quarter of a second."
"Decreasing the width of the slit one half, proportionally reduces the time of the exposure, and by this means, in connection with an increase in the speed with which the curtain is moved, an exposure of ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of a second is possible."
"In addition to possessing the advantage of great speed, this shutter also passes a higher percentage of light than a lens shutter even when the actual time of the so-called exposure is the same."
"This is due to the fact that the lens opening is in no way affected, it being the same throughout the exposure."
"With a lens shutter, on the contrary, the full value of the opening is given for only a fractional part of the exposure, the parts of the shutter more or less filling the opening during the rest of the time."
"With a focal-plane shutter, therefore, one may do rapid work under conditions where a lens shutter could not be successfully employed; time exposures, however, can not be made with the focal-plane shutter, and for all-around work the camera should be fitted with both a lens and a focal-plane shutter."
"The reflecting camera, as before stated, is fitted with a focal-plane shutter, and, as described, it is released by pressing the lever, which raises the mirror."
"When the exposure is to be made from a distance as much as one hundred feet of tubing may be employed."
"The ordinary tubing sold by photographers will not be found so well adapted to long-distance work as a less elastic kind, which does not so readily yield to pressure and transmits a larger portion of the force applied when squeezing the bulb."
"—A stout two-length tripod is to be preferred to one of the slender multifolding type, in which stability is sacrificed to weight and size."
"The legs, except the inner sides of the upper section into which the lower section slides, and brass work should be painted bark color in order to make them as inconspicuous as possible."
"With it a camera can easily be attached to the limb of a tree, rung of a ladder, or, by screwing a block on to the head of the tripod, it may be employed in connection with the tripod—in fact its applicability will be evident to every one using it."
"However, it is advisable to select the one you think the most rapid and use it to the exclusion of all others."
"Under certain circumstances—in photographing Robins, for instance—isochromatic plates will be found desirable, and 23where a strong head light can not be avoided nonhalation plates may be employed."
"So much industry, skill, and patience are generally required of the bird photographer before he makes an exposure that he should guard against all chances of failure from the photographic side."
"It is therefore advisable to thoroughly test plates which it is probable may be exposed on a very difficult subject."
"Under no circumstances should the plate holders be needlessly exposed to the light, and when the camera is to be left for an indefinite period with the slide drawn from the holder and plate ready to expose, it should be carefully wrapped in the dark-cloth."
"—As the sportsman constructs blinds in which he may conceal himself from his prey, so the bird photographer may employ various means of hiding from his subjects."
"The Keartons recommend an artificial tree trunk for use in wooded places and an artificial rubbish heap for open fields."
"The frame of the Keartons’ is of bamboo, but I find white pine answers very well, the main things to be considered being lightness and portability."
"The Keartons’ field blind or “rubbish heap” consists of an umbrella, to each of the ribs of which strips of bamboo four feet in length are tied."
"This is then covered with light brown holland and wisps of straw tied over it in such a way as to “virtually thatch the whole structure."
", without assistance, and I fear that the inconvenience attending their use will restrict them to the few enthusiasts who count neither time, labor, nor cost in attaining a desired end."
"For my own part, I prefer, when possible, to conceal my camera and make the exposure from a distance rather than to weight myself with a portable blind and to endure the discomforts of being confined within it."
"—The bird photographer will find that he requires numerous articles not usually to be found in the regulation photographic outfit, as, for example, climbers for ascending trees and stout cords for hauling the camera up after him; a dark-cloth, green in color, to aid in disguising the camera, and a mirror."
"A good plan is to buy a piece of glass of desired size and frame it simply in white pine."
"It may then be attached to a limb, a stick driven in the ground, or other convenient object, by means of the ball-and-socket clamp mentioned under Tripods, which may be screwed into the back or the outer border of the frame."
"Such a mirror will reflect sunlight many yards to shaded nests, where, in photographing old or young birds, a quick exposure is necessary."
"A vest-pocket mirror, for use in reflecting the reading of the diaphragms or time on the shutter, will permit one to make the desired changes from the rear, and thus prove helpful 25when conditions do not permit one to work in front of the camera."
"A device which might be arranged on the principle of a trap, the trigger to be sprung and exposure made when the bait is taken, would doubtless capture some interesting pictures."
"The connection with the camera shutter was so made that the deer, in walking, touched a cord which exploded the flash-light, and, at the same moment, made the exposure."
"The light weight of most birds, however, requires a much more delicate apparatus, while an even greater difficulty is found in the movement caused by the release of the trigger, which startles the bird just as the exposure is made."
"Thus far in my experiments I have been unable to overcome these objections, but I trust some other bird photographer will be more successful."
"Those who are ambitious in the direction of cliff photography I would refer to the Keartons’ admirable treatise on the subject in their Wild Life at Home, for a description of the paraphernalia needed and the manner in which it should be used."
"My own experience in this line is limited, and I confess to the utter absence of a desire to increase it!"
"Pollution is the presence or introduction into the environment of a substance or thing that has harmful or poisonous effects."
"Pollution can have a variety of negative impacts on the environment, including harm to wildlife and natural ecosystems, as well as negative effects on human health."
"It is important to reduce pollution and protect the environment to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our planet."
"Although it is an issue that has been prevalent since ancient times, in the 21st century its harmful effect has been felt on a large scale."
"Although the governments of different countries have taken several major steps to curb these effects, there is still a long way to go."
"These substances can be either man-made or naturally occurring, but either way, they can have serious negative impacts on human health and the environment."
"Water pollution is the presence in water of harmful substances or organisms that can have negative impacts on human health, the environment, and aquatic life."
"Water pollution can occur in natural bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, as well as in man-made water systems, such as reservoirs, aqueducts, and sewage treatment plants."
"Agricultural runoff: Pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste can run off of farmland and into nearby bodies of water, polluting the water."
"Sewage and sewage treatment plants: If sewage treatment plants are not properly maintained, sewage and other waste products can be released into bodies of water, polluting the water."
"Oil spills: Oil spills can occur as a result of human activities, such as the transportation of oil, or they can occur naturally."
"Litter: Litter, such as plastic bags and bottles, can end up in bodies of water, where it can harm wildlife and pollute the water."
"Soil Pollution:Soil pollution, also known as soil contamination, is the presence in soil of harmful substances or contaminants that can have negative impacts on human health, the environment, and agricultural productivity."
"Soil pollution can have a variety of causes, including agricultural practices, industrial activities, waste disposal, and the use of certain chemicals and products in the home."
"Soil pollution can have serious consequences, including harm to plants and wildlife, contamination of the food supply, and negative impacts on human health."
"Noise pollution can be caused by a variety of sources, including traffic, industrial activities, construction, transportation, music and entertainment, and neighbors."
"It is important to reduce noise pollution and protect against excessive or unwanted noise to ensure the long-term health and well-being of people and wildlife."
"Often, the day after the festival of Diwali it is reported in the media how the bursting of crackers caused an increase in noise pollution in major cities of India."
"Although these are the four major  categories of pollution lifestyle changes have caused several other types as well such as Radioactive Pollution, Light Pollution among others."
