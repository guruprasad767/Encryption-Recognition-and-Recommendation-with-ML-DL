"The scale on most of these shutters calls for a speed not exceeding a ¹⁄₁₀₀ part of a second, but this is far too slow an exposure to successfully photograph a flying bird at short range where a speed of at least ¹⁄₅₀₀ of a second is required.","140b61b2351321f5dea9bfb0eeb2213766ea5da3cff3c5f1f641c07831b34070"
"For very rapid work the choice is limited to one kind of shutter—that is, the focal-plane, which in effect is a curtain with an adjustable slit which is placed directly in front of the plate.","4eaa9da5fd1072743550857156a89dfb91bcabed17500e03be5e1daccac8de30"
"Great speed with this shutter is in part secured by increasing the tension of the spring, which acts as its motive 21power, but more particularly by decreasing the width of the slit.","c54f6f3c379cfb388e4c32f7967a6c0ac2b29ff6b98be1d1b77444e0cdba1e09"
"Assuming, therefore, that it takes one second for the slit to pass from top to bottom of a plate four inches high, and that the slit is one inch in width, it follows that each portion of the plate is exposed to the light for a quarter of a second.","a6431143ecc8a69140a10484d289ae7d6d120d7c8639cfefacd79efae9454575"
"Decreasing the width of the slit one half, proportionally reduces the time of the exposure, and by this means, in connection with an increase in the speed with which the curtain is moved, an exposure of ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of a second is possible.","7e6e0b34f7bd355fa9a5a15bb444b46aab409313c14e199c383e8b372d0a24b3"
"In addition to possessing the advantage of great speed, this shutter also passes a higher percentage of light than a lens shutter even when the actual time of the so-called exposure is the same.","64762b5bcbaac403373fbd95e1a990e6c5b9253294333a45476ab9a24eaa7a17"
"This is due to the fact that the lens opening is in no way affected, it being the same throughout the exposure.","275463d546d0a643e6d9522c0610bf54cf603f247b89bc56b93549247ea6ad5f"
"With a lens shutter, on the contrary, the full value of the opening is given for only a fractional part of the exposure, the parts of the shutter more or less filling the opening during the rest of the time.","3c848d41a0dba9fb66ee3ee2b481d037b1396ecc4d58b4dc8e0091ae421b33dd"
"With a focal-plane shutter, therefore, one may do rapid work under conditions where a lens shutter could not be successfully employed; time exposures, however, can not be made with the focal-plane shutter, and for all-around work the camera should be fitted with both a lens and a focal-plane shutter.","183552e4d238f9e233e2e8bef61eb516dd6ee87fdb4232675a433a24adfee06b"

"With it a camera can easily be attached to the limb of a tree, rung of a ladder, or, by screwing a block on to the head of the tripod, it may be employed in connection with the tripod—in fact its applicability will be evident to every one using it.","b005b32c756d1da6bfba85fd78937623b7e34b0378f3ea17ef19b9b8f7c3c602"

"So much industry, skill, and patience are generally required of the bird photographer before he makes an exposure that he should guard against all chances of failure from the photographic side.","62301ad0ac664067955f96cb497189c0d944b239e6134bbc814c3eaba73615ee"
