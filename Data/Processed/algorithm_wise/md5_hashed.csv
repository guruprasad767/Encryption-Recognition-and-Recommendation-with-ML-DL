"To fully meet these demands of distance and time two lenses would be needed; but, aside from the increased cost and the inconvenience of 11using two lenses, the great size and weight of a long-focus lens are drawbacks.","4db499d843f1cf96bea30af2b6d44d12"
"These objections are largely overcome by the use of the symmetrical lenses placed in most of the long-focus boxes, or, if expense be not considered, by a “convertible” lens.","4b1457ee5f7f59032433da74feda7cf1"
"The combined focus of the front and back lenses is seven and a half inches, of either of the lenses alone, fifteen inches.","e4387adf5d1b4467c84462bdcaafacb9"

"This combination is preferred to one in which the component lenses are of different foci, because of the 12greater speed of the two when combined, and furthermore, because, being of the same focus, they could, if occasion arose, be used in a twin-lens box.","66198739a36e085554bdaa47e42bff24"

"However, with such subjects as nests high in trees or on cliffs, Herons and other shore-inhabiting birds, Ducks on the water or Hawks perched in leafless trees, the telephoto will be found serviceable.","3c3a67c33242b4c411fd8f4c7ffd7338"

"13These enlargements may be made with an enlarging camera or with the aid of a Nehring enlarging lens, which is placed between the front and back lenses of the view lens, when, with the ordinary long-focus camera, a magnification of about four diameters may be obtained, the image being thrown on to a piece of bromide paper in the plate holder.","0ce9276416a0c3105c186468f9c65a4e"
"Through enlargement many apparently worthless negatives become of value, and in some instances pictures can be made from different parts of the same negative.","c32846e7127d6ed4042ccbcfcc93ab62"

"As a matter of information, however, it seems eminently desirable to accompany all enlarged pictures by a statement of the extent of their magnification, and throughout this book this plan is followed.","dbaaffb0ab679eb09def9aec79dad6e2"
"Consequently, when there is no mention of enlargement, it may be accepted as a fact that the print from which the reproduction was made was obtained from the negative by contact.","310c3edf60cf0e26f2d5f2f3729c8caa"

"Placing a mounted Flicker (Colaptes auratus) on a fence post, and setting up my tripod at a measured distance of fifty feet, a series of test exposures was made, of which three are presented as follows: First,2 eight-inch lens (Zeiss Convertible Series VII a, No.","6558ec30fdb61bc00ad897c8c185b880"
"Commenting on the results of these tests it may first be mentioned that in the “Unicum” shutter employed exposures of a so-called “¹⁄₁₀₀” and “¹⁄₂₅” seconds gave exactly the same results both with the combined eight-inch lens and the front fourteen-inch lens; the actual time, however, was doubtless not far from ¹⁄₂₅ of a second.","cb341694bb984a6ed6cbbc5c1b22ba53"
"Continuing our comparison, 16we observe that the eight-inch gives a fairly wide field, excellent depth of focus, but a very small image of the bird, for which alone the picture has been made.","dc0ce2f62e21355df8c32bd8e1660d35"
"With the fourteen-inch we decrease the extent of the field nearly one half and almost double the size of the object pictured.","18964f9d557009195e0e7fca7b577149"
"This, however, has been done at the loss of depth of focus, not even the first of the line of posts running directly into the background being sharply defined, while with the eight-inch all are in focus.","435b743311dfd16e5d96059aa0a5c2dd"
"The telephoto gives an enlargement of about six diameters of the image thrown by eight-inch lens, and three diameters increase of that of the fourteen-inch lens.","a02e9927d4bc05a8f5a15502633fba94"
"Having now made three good negatives in the field, we may, by enlargement, improve on the image of the bird obtained.","4f270d38bc9985f83cd924b7f2cb3007"
"The possibilities in this direction are clearly shown by the three enlargements accompanying the contact prints from their respective negatives.","9efa6da1ee75239e5324ef3719cccffb"
"In each instance the enlargement is about three diameters, and the telephoto negative of course furnishes the most satisfactory picture.","58c43845bd161505ce3ab7f54a7de188"
"When the difficulties of telephotography are considered, however, and the ¹⁄₂₅-second exposure of the fourteen-inch lens, which permits of hand work, is compared with the one second of the telephoto, we believe that for general work in photographing 19birds a lens having a focal length of at least fourteen inches will be found the most satisfactory.","fcfa86543bc0ef09728ade54cbc32613"
"It should be added that, in order to make them wholly comparable, the three contact prints as well as the enlargements were made on enameled bromide paper.","55d9b8adb1414ba5831b40c7f6aad8eb"
"—For fairly rapid, slow, and time exposures, a lens shutter, such as is sold with trade cameras, will be found suitable.","052fe3d245e0d213256d191ff03792c9"
"The “Iris Diaphragm” shutter is noiseless 20when used for slow exposures of two or three seconds, a matter of much importance in making time pictures of sitting birds, who are apt to turn their head if they hear the click of the shutter.","0c49339ce599e03131ad21efcf896e37"
"The “Unicum” shutter is lighter, responds quickly, has a lever to which a thread may be attached for making exposures from a distance, can be easily diaphragmed from the rear, but is not wholly noiseless.","906b43607937c54dc564ee2d22ce1f7a"
"There are also other shutters, each possessing good points of its own, and the selection of any one of them for use in medium rapid, slow, or time work can be left to the photographer, who should, however, remember that the time scales on these shutters represent degrees of difference and not exact measurements of time, and that there is great variation in the exposures of different shutters of the same make when similarly adjusted.","ed1ebc609b3862a4c15ea0f0c6288bf9"
"The scale on most of these shutters calls for a speed not exceeding a ¹⁄₁₀₀ part of a second, but this is far too slow an exposure to successfully photograph a flying bird at short range where a speed of at least ¹⁄₅₀₀ of a second is required.","41447fae66297a2e9c2fb613e3b3a139"
"For very rapid work the choice is limited to one kind of shutter—that is, the focal-plane, which in effect is a curtain with an adjustable slit which is placed directly in front of the plate.","85592e22a48ac829a5cbf72d09d7ae0d"
"Great speed with this shutter is in part secured by increasing the tension of the spring, which acts as its motive 21power, but more particularly by decreasing the width of the slit.","fceb5ecc3259fe4fd697b31c64c962e4"
"Assuming, therefore, that it takes one second for the slit to pass from top to bottom of a plate four inches high, and that the slit is one inch in width, it follows that each portion of the plate is exposed to the light for a quarter of a second.","a6dbbb94ae53182973a0e4b8f8c76651"
"Decreasing the width of the slit one half, proportionally reduces the time of the exposure, and by this means, in connection with an increase in the speed with which the curtain is moved, an exposure of ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of a second is possible.","069e854f9cdc9d6c675942783a2807cd"
"In addition to possessing the advantage of great speed, this shutter also passes a higher percentage of light than a lens shutter even when the actual time of the so-called exposure is the same.","4c54b89415e83803b290520a686b2951"
"This is due to the fact that the lens opening is in no way affected, it being the same throughout the exposure.","88cbd29933dee5b46bc8728111796693"
"With a lens shutter, on the contrary, the full value of the opening is given for only a fractional part of the exposure, the parts of the shutter more or less filling the opening during the rest of the time.","0020084538085c28231c70af9c0ee95b"
"With a focal-plane shutter, therefore, one may do rapid work under conditions where a lens shutter could not be successfully employed; time exposures, however, can not be made with the focal-plane shutter, and for all-around work the camera should be fitted with both a lens and a focal-plane shutter.","ab265fcea15bc8ec6517d79ea15f14dc"

"When the exposure is to be made from a distance as much as one hundred feet of tubing may be employed.","49d4b0960813f4687f781604651530b9"
"The ordinary tubing sold by photographers will not be found so well adapted to long-distance work as a less elastic kind, which does not so readily yield to pressure and transmits a larger portion of the force applied when squeezing the bulb.","0b46c53c1bfe162f12c78e2eac795493"
